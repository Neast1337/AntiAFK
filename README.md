Creating a GitHub repository format for your AntiAFK plugin description involves setting up a clear structure to showcase its features, installation instructions, configuration options, and support details. Hereâ€™s how you can structure it:

### AntiAFK Plugin

#### Description
The AntiAFK plugin manages and mitigates player inactivity on Minecraft servers. Players idle for too long are marked AFK and may be kicked to ensure active player participation and server resource efficiency.

#### Features
- **Automatic AFK Detection:** Marks idle players as AFK after a configurable time.
- **Customizable Messages:** Personalize messages for AFK marking and kick notifications.
- **Title and Subtitle Notifications:** Displays prompts to AFK players via titles and subtitles.
- **Sound Alerts:** Customizable sounds for AFK marking and admin notifications.
- **Admin Notifications:** Alerts server operators of AFK players and kicks.
- **Permission Support:** Permissions for bypassing AFK checks and executing plugin commands.
